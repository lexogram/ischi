  /** Two cases: room host and player joining the room
   *
   *  1. The room host will have sent a "create_event_room"
   *     message to the server and will have received a
   *     "room_created" message in reply, with a content like
   *     { ..., gameData, ... }. So gameData will already be set.
   *
   *     If the host reconnects, WSContext will attempt to
   *     restoreUserId(), and the userIdRestored() function will
   *     call joinRoom(), so again `gameData` will be set.
   *
   *  2. A player who joins the room will have been sent here
   *     by the Event Route, which read in the `room_host` param
   *     and called EventContext's setRoomHost(). This player
   *     will not have joined the room yet. Joining the room
   *     triggers setUserNameAndRoom() in the ischi.js script on
   *     the server, which sends a "gameData" message which
   *     triggers loadGameData() in GameContext, and then we'll
   *     re-render Preview with gameData all set.
   *
   *     getGameData() is only triggered by useEffect the first
   *     time this Preview component is rendered.
   *
   *     If a player disconnects and then reconnects, the same
   *     sequence will occur.
